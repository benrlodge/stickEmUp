## Stick Em Up!


I created Stick Em Up so I could have a flexible and easy way to set fixed positioning on elements based on where visitors are scrolling on webpages.

What is really just does is tell you when a given elements has been reached. Once it's been reached, a class is added to the element (which gives the fixed positioning, but you can really do whatever you want). Once the element is reached again in the opposite direction, that class is removed. Please read on for more specifics.
